# BNS Bluetooth Library for RobotC

Includes:
  * Functions and examples for sending and recieving commands over UART
  * AT Commands for reprogramming HC05 bluetooth modules.  
  
Connecting a HC05 to a Vex Cortex is not difficult at all.  
The HC05 module commonly found online can be powered from a 5V source, and the TX/RX pins run at 3.3V, so no conversion is necessary from the Cortex to the module.
For reprogramming it, connect the "key" pin to 5V (Disclaimer: this could potentionally damage your device as it's not made to run at 5V.  Use a voltage divider  down to 3.3V if you want to be safe).
